Brown sugar has a darker color and a sweeter taste than white sugar. While white sugar is widely available, brown sugar is often sold as a healthier alternative. Some health benefits of brown sugar include a lower glycemic index, which means it can help regulate blood sugar levels, and a lower calorie count. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that brown sugar is healthier than white sugar.", "latency_ms": 32252}
