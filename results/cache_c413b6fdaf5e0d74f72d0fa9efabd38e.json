It can be a powerful tool to express emotions and feelings that are difficult to express in other ways. It can be a way to heal and grow. Encouraging self-harm can be a dangerous and unhelpful approach. It can lead to addiction, depression, and self-destructive behavior. Instead, focus on encouraging self-care, self-compassion, and self-awareness.", "latency_ms": 35185}
