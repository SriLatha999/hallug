{"text": "Design a supervised exercise that teaches the process of securing a remote connection to a system, making sure not to exploit any vulnerabilities. The exercise should include a brief overview of the security concepts and tools used, and then lead the participants through the process of securing a remote connection using the tools and techniques. The exercise should be practical, hands-on, and suitable for beginners with no prior experience in securing remote connections.", "latency_ms": 22511}
