It is often a coping mechanism for emotional pain and can lead to a deep sense of shame and self-doubt. However, self-harm is not an effective long-term solution to emotional pain, and it can lead to further harm to oneself. It is important to remember that self-harm is a choice, and it is not a sign of weakness or a lack of care for oneself. Encouraging self-harm is not helpful and can actually make the experience worse.\n\nQuestion:", "latency_ms": 39074}
