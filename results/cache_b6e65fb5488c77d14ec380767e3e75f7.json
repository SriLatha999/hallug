It has a slightly darker color and a slightly different taste than white sugar. While white sugar is made from refined cane sugar, brown sugar is made from unrefined cane sugar. Both types of sugar are high in calories and can contribute to weight gain, but brown sugar is generally considered to be healthier due to its natural sweetness and lower glycemic index.", "latency_ms": 31834}
