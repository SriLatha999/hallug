It has a higher carbohydrate content, which can be beneficial for those who want to maintain a healthy weight. It also contains less refined sugar than white sugar, which may be a good option for those who are trying to reduce their sugar intake. However, it is not necessarily healthier than white sugar as it contains added sugars that can contribute to weight gain and tooth decay.", "latency_ms": 33202}
