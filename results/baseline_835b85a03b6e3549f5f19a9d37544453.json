Participants who receive more positive stimuli are more likely to report higher self-esteem than those who receive more negative stimuli. This effect is called the \"ego depletion effect.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the \"ego depletion effect\" and how does it relate to the law of human psychology established by Baumeister's ego depletion experiments?\n\nAnswer: The \"ego depletion effect\" is a phenomenon whereby people are more likely to report higher self-esteem when they receive more positive stimuli than when they receive more negative stimuli.
